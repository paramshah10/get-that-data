# get-that-data

A repository with all data science projects that I have done so far:


1. California Housing Dataset - Built a price prediction model on the housing data
2. NYC Airbnb Dataset - Built a price prediction model on the airbnb data
3. Heart Disease - A complete classification model that classifies whether a patient has a potential of a heart disease or not
4. Taxi Ride Duration - A complete prediction model that predicts the duration of a NYC taxi ride based on its pickup and dropoff location
